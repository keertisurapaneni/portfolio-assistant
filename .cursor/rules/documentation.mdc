# Documentation & Plans

## Save Useful Plans

When a conversation produces a solid implementation plan (architecture, feature design, multi-step approach), save it to `docs/cursor/` so it's preserved:

```
docs/cursor/
  YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md
```

Include: goal, approach, key decisions, and any trade-offs discussed.

## Keep Docs Updated

After significant changes (new features, architecture changes, new edge functions, new DB tables), update the relevant docs:

- `README.md` — project overview, setup instructions
- `supabase/functions/README.md` — edge function docs
- Feature-specific docs in `docs/`

Don't create docs for trivial changes. Use judgment — if a future dev would be confused without it, document it.
